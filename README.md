## User Stores

#### As a user I would like to be rewarded for my time spent answering the questions/voting on images, that way I don't feel like I am wasting my time.

#### As a developer of the app I would like data to be shown in a clear & concise manner for moving forward with the next stage of printing brochures.

#### As a user I owuld like the page/survey to be as user friendly and appealing as possible, so that I enjoy the overall experience as much as possible.

#### As an admin of the site I'd like to be able to easily change the variables such as the # of images shown at a time for voting.
